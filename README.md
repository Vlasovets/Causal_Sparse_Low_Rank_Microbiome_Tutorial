## Introduction
Microbiome data analysis often involves high-dimensional and sparse datasets. This tutorial demonstrates how to apply causal inference techniques to such data using sparse and low-rank methods.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Causal_Sparse_Low_Rank_Microbiome_Tutorial.git
cd Causal_Sparse_Low_Rank_Microbiome_Tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Follow the steps in the tutorial notebooks to learn how to apply causal inference methods to microbiome data. The notebooks are located in the `notebooks` directory.
